	<p>
Humans have put themselves on top of a food chain that they organically were not meant to be in. Being at this stature gives us the power and responsibility to look after the needs of those who can't speak for themselves. When we envision an ideal world, most of us forget to consider the well being of the animals, from whom we continue to take so much. 
On every street, at every corner, helpless voiceless stray dogs are to be found. Estimates say that Delhi is home to about 400,000 stray dogs and how many of them receive a proper diet that fulfils their physical requirement? Probably half.
<br><br>
Nursing Tails is an initiative started by five teenagers who picture themselves in an ideal world where no animal needs to worry about their next meal. When we look at such helpless creatures, we realise that the amount of food that can mean the world to them is usually wasted or might go unnoticed by our households. 
<br><br>
Five teenagers cannot change the world but by being a part of this initiative you can help us take us a step closer towards our vision.
